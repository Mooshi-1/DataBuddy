import requests

# Replace with the actual IMS API endpoint and your credentials

headers = {'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'}

# Make a GET request to the IMS API
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

# To get started, you'll need to use the appropriate APIs provided by IMS. IMS offers several APIs for accessing its database and transaction management features1. Here are a few steps to help you get started:

# Identify the API: Determine which API you need to use based on your requirements. IMS provides APIs for database access, transaction management, and more.

# Set Up Your Environment: Ensure you have the necessary tools and libraries installed. For example, you might need a library like requests for making HTTP requests in Python.

# Authenticate: Make sure you have the necessary credentials and permissions to access the IMS API.

# Make API Calls: Use the API to pull data from IMS. Here's a basic example using Python and the requests library:

#example pushing into IMS
import requests
import json

# Replace with the actual IMS API endpoint and your credentials
url = 'https://ims.example.com/api/data'
headers = {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}

# Data to be pushed to the IMS
data = {
    'field1': 'value1',
    'field2': 'value2',
    # Add more fields as needed
}

# Convert the data to JSON format
json_data = json.dumps(data)

# Make a POST request to the IMS API to create a new record
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json_data)

# Check if the request was successful
if response.status_code == 201:
    print('Data pushed successfully!')
else:
    print(f'Error: {response.status_code} - {response.text}')



# Hybrid Approach
# In some cases, a hybrid approach can be beneficial. You can use Python for certain tasks and have a backend to handle others. For example, you could use Flask or Django to build a lightweight backend that handles API calls, user authentication, and data management, while still leveraging Python for data analysis and processing.

# Hereâ€™s a simple example of how you might set up a backend using Flask:
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import requests

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/fetch-data', methods=['GET'])
def fetch_data():
    # Example IMS API call
    url = 'https://ims.example.com/api/data'
    headers = {'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'}
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return jsonify(response.json())
    else:
        return jsonify({'error': 'Failed to fetch data'}), response.status_code

@app.route('/push-data', methods=['POST'])
def push_data():
    data = request.json
    url = 'https://ims.example.com/api/data'
    headers = {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
    
    if response.status_code == 201:
        return jsonify({'message': 'Data pushed successfully!'})
    else:
        return jsonify({'error': 'Failed to push data'}), response.status_code

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
