SHIMADZU_SAMPLEINIT()
done?

create subclasses
different types of QC
initialize from parent class and add any variables that it needs
only need to do this if the class needs additional arguments
ex: SR control should check for its 2 related cases
-need to work out details and what variables are needed
SR()
MOA()
DILN()

determine what to bind
case_bind()
if sample in sample_duplicate:
sample + sample_duplicate
account for samples in single

cal_curve()
create cal curve
order - shooter, neg, 1-6

ctl_set()
create list of controls
order controls with lambda
calculate 50-200% range
dilution control???

batch_pack()
bind
curve + cal_curve + diln_ctl + ctl_set + seq

find_analyte_errors(self, other)
if len(self.analytes) != len(other.analytes)
print(analyte mismatch)
#example, cocaine found in 1 duplicate but not the other

find_ISTD_errors(self, other)
same as analyte

export to csv
export to fillable pdf
fillpdf, pypdfform, 
point it to LF form and have it make a copy, rename to case number, input data
